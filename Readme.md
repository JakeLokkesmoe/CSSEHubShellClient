# CSSE Hub Shell Client
============
This is a simple client for the UW Platteville CSSE Hub in the form of a shell script.

## Instalation
Clone this repository and than run:

```
cd CSSEHubShellClient
cp punchin.sh /usr/local/bin/punchin
chmod +rx /usr/local/bin/punchin
```

This will install the shell script in your local usr bin. Assuming you have /usr/local/bin on your $PATH, you can now punch in to CSSE hub by running `punchin` from a terminal.

## Features
Right now, all it can do is punch in to the CSSE Hub.
